I worked as part of the interdisciplinary [CAMBI](https://www.cambi.tech/about) team to develop a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that enables people with severe speech disorders to type using only their brain signals. I was the lead developer for the machine learning and sequential decision-making modules, and my theoretical contributions helped double the typing speed of users in out-of-context and adversarial scenarios.

Check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_vTE8KpEsU&t=1s) where our team explains the system (you can spot me at **2:52**!). I also co-designed the open-source BCI software BciPy, and led the development of its machine learning pipeline. [[Github]](https://github.com/CAMBI-tech/BciPy/)
