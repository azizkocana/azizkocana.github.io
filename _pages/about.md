I am a machine learning and signal processing professional who codes and does math on a daily basis, I mainly work on deep learning, time series analysis and computer vision. My focus is on machine learning and AI applied on biomedical systems. I have experience in a diverse set of biomedical applications which include brain-computer interfaces, magnetic resonance imaging and reconstruction, diagnostic systems and assistive monitoring systems. My (research) interests include:
1. Machine learning guided time series analysis and reasoning
2. Deep learning applications for biomedical systems
3. Active inferencing and sequential decision making
4. Information theoritic objective design

Since 2021, I am working as a machine learning research scientist at [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html). I am developing machine learning algorithms and AI for ADI's biological sensing platform to provide medical diagnostics. I have been enjoying working on cutting edge technologies in the cross-section of signal processing, machine learning, sensor fusion.

In 2020, I was a postdoctoral research associate in [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) and [Boston Children's Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/) in [QUIN](https://research.childrenshospital.org/quin/)-[CRL](http://crl.med.harvard.edu/). The focus of my fellowship was deep learning methods for dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstructions systems. I mainly worked on motion correction for fast image reconstruction from undersampled MRI.

I received my Ph.D. in electrical engineering from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) under [Prof. Deniz Erdogmus](https://web.northeastern.edu/deniz/) in 2020. In my Ph.D., I was the part of the Consortium for [Accessible Multimodal Brain-Body Interfaces](https://www.cambi.tech/), where our main aim was to provide accessible communication systems for people with speech impairments. I contributed to deep learning and AI driven brain-computer-interfaced typing systems. My theoretical contributions were in sequential decision making and active Bayesian inferencing. 

During my Ph.D. experience, I also attended [Gordon Engineering Leadership Program](https://gordon.northeastern.edu/) and became a fellow. I got trained in productization, market research and tehnical-leadership. My thesis was on commercialization possibilities of brain-computer-interfaces. 

 I received my MSc. in telecommunications engineering from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en) under [Ilker Bayram](https://ilkerbayram.github.io/) in 2016. I mainly focused on audio dereverbaration and denoising with convex formulations. I also hold a BSc. in electronics engineering and a BSc. in math from Istanbul Technical University awarded in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
