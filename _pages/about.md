I am a machine learning and signal processing professional with a deep passion for designing intelligent systems. I specialize in developing algorithms and writing code across deep learning, time series analysis, and computer vision. My work focuses on applying machine learning and AI to biomedical systems, with extensive experience in diverse applications such as brain-computer interfaces, MRI reconstruction, diagnostic tools, and assistive monitoring systems.

Since 2021, I’ve been working as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html), developing machine learning algorithms and AI for ADI’s biological sensing platform to enable advanced medical diagnostics. In 2025, I was promoted to Manager of Machine Learning and Algorithms, where I lead high-impact projects at the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, and sensor fusion. Despite my leadership role, I continue to contribute as a strong individual contributor, working on innovative solutions that bridge hardware and AI for real-world applications.

In 2020, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) and [Boston Children's Hospital](https://www.childrenshospital.org/) in the QUIN-CRL labs. My fellowship focused on deep learning methods for dynamic MRI reconstruction systems, particularly for motion correction and fast image reconstruction from undersampled MRI data.

I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in 2020, under the guidance of Prof. Deniz Erdogmus and Prof. Murat Akcakaya. My research was part of the Consortium for Accessible Multimodal Brain-Body Interfaces, where we worked on providing accessible communication systems for people with speech impairments. I made significant contributions to deep learning-driven brain-computer interface typing systems, with a focus on sequential decision-making and active Bayesian inference.

During my Ph.D., I also participated in the [Gordon Engineering Leadership Program](https://gordon.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern, where I trained as a fellow in productization, market research, and technical leadership. My thesis explored the commercialization potential of brain-computer interfaces.

I earned my MSc. in Telecommunications Engineering from [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en) in 2016, with a focus on audio dereverberation and denoising. I also hold BSc. degrees in Electronics Engineering and Mathematics both from Istanbul Technical University, awarded in 2014 and 2015, respectively.
